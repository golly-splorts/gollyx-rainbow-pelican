# About GollyX Toroidal Cup

GollyX is the experimental version of [Golly](https://golly.life).

Golly implements a two-color version of Conway's Game of Life, and GollyX implements
other versions of cellular autonoma rules and colors.

The Toroidal Cup is an implementation of a two-color version of Conway's Game of Life
on a grid with periodic boundary conditions (the bottom boundary is connected to the
top boundary, and the left boundary is connected to the right boundary, as on a toroid).

For more information, see <https://golly.life/about>.
